# EncryptedChatroom
- A variation on PyNet that integrates encryption into the communication 

## Communication states

0. A -> B (encrypted by A)
1. A <- B (encrypted by A and B)
2. A -> B (encrypted by B)

## Additions for the new encryption communication program

1. When an @ is placed in front of a name highlight it (preferably \033_46m (replaceing _ with opening square bracket)) - It's added in the current server for recommendation.
2. Change colours in command - colour dictionary
